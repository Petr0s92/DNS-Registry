DNS Registry Control Panel

A simple control panel to allow users to register domains on private TLDs.

This system is only a Registry providing delegations to nameservers for each domain registered.


The zones are written on a MySQL Database and served via PowerDNS with it's MySQL Backend.
The db schema is almost identical to that of PowerDNS and Poweradmin.


See CREDITS for other software used in this system.
