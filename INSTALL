Edit includes/config.php.sample and add the MySQL Credentials.

Login with
Username: admin
Password: admin

Go to the `Settings` section to configure some general settings of the system before start using it.

Then you go to TLDs to insert the TLDs you want to manage with this control panel.


You have to manually create and configure the TLD zone on PowerDNS server.


This control panel only abstracts the PowerDNS database into users and delegated domains for easier management of a private TLD.
