Requirements:

Apache 2+
PHP 5.2+
MySQL 5+
PEAR Net_DNS 1.0.7

Installation:

First create a database and credentials to be used by PowerDNS and the DNS Registry Control Panel.
Import the db_schema.sql schema into the newly created database.

Copy all files to a web accessible directory. Eg: /dns

Edit includes/config.php.sample and add the MySQL Credentials.
Save as config.php

Visit http://your_domain/dns
Login with:
Username: admin
Password: admin


Go to the `Settings` section to configure some general settings of the system before start using it.

Then you go to TLDs to insert the TLDs you want to manage with this control panel.

You have to manually create and configure the TLD zone(s) on PowerDNS server.

This control panel only abstracts the PowerDNS database into users and delegated domains for easier management of a private TLD.
